#### Comment
We observe that we achieve 71.4% success rate for gender with two criteria, 66.0% for activity with three criteria, and 51.3% for age with four criteria.
We are approximately losing 10% per additional criterion. According to the datasets, we are within +/- 5%.

## Conclusion
The best prompts for the gender is : **"man", "women"**  
The best prompts for the age is : **"children", "adolescent", "adult", "senior"**  
The best prompts for activities is : **"hiker", "skier", "bicyclist"**  
Modifying prompts for one criterion doesn't affect the predictions of other criteria since we classify the image several times (once per criterion).
For Compute time, changing prompts doesn't affect the Compute time. Time increases when adding new prompts.

## Conclusion
Singular is more effective than plural, except for children, it's better to input 'children' than 'child'.
The length of the prompts affects the quality of classification. For activities, we manage to increase precision with a short prompt, but for gender and age, it's no better.
The order of prompts matters too, but the difference is very, very insignificant.  
Best combination : **"man", "woman", "children", "adolescent", "adult", "senior", "it's a hiker", "it's a skier", "it's a bicyclist"**
